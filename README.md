## Installation
You can install the project from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dockview). The project comes with TypeScript typings.

```
npm install --save dockview
```

## Setup

You must import or reference the stylesheet at `dockview/dist/styles/dockview.css`. For example:

```css
@import '~dockview/dist/styles/dockview.css';
```

You should also attach a dockview theme to an element containing your components. For example:

```html
<body classname="dockview-theme-light">
</body>
```

dockview has a peer dependency on `react >= 16.8.0` and `react-dom >= 16.8.0` which is the version that introduced [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

## FAQ
### Can I use this library without React?
In theory, yes. The library is written in plain-old JS and the parts written in ReactJS are merely wrappers around the plain-old JS components. Currently everything is published as one package though so maybe that's something to change in the future.

### Can I use this library with AngularJS/Vue.js or any other arbitrarily named JavaScript library/framework?
Yes but with some extra work. Dockview is written in plain-old JS so you can either interact directly with the plain-old JS components or create a wrapper using your prefered library/framework. The React wrapper may give some ideas on how this wrapper implementation could be done for other libraries/frameworks. Maybe that's something to change in the future.
